        <p class = "prj1-description"> Class Finder is a Website utilized for students in need of finding study areas around campus, mainly classrooms.
          The main premise being that through this website they can find out empty classrooms around the area with the respective times. 
          They also get access to the option of reserving the classrooms beforehand for easy  access.<br>
          This Website was built by me and three other students during the Hackathon event. We mainly used HTML and CSS with a bit of understanding on Cockroach
          DB databases.
